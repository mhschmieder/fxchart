/**
 * The Time Series Chart Pane is the abstract base class that serves as a
 * container for Time Series charts in JavaFX.
 * <p>
 * Class derivation from FX Charts is deprecated for a variety of legitimate
 * reasons, so we prefer composition to inheritance.
 * <p>
 * This class attempts to cover as much ground as possible without getting into
 * specifics that might vary between different usage contexts or application
 * domains. Even so, it is geared towards Signal Processing and Analysis.
 * <p>
 * The x-axis units are not mandated here. All that matters is that downstream
 * clients use consistent units and supply the measurement unit to display.
 * <p>
 * TODO: Make an enumeration of typical time units and pass as a variable, then
 *  convert to the displayed measurement unit string here vs. in the invoker?
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This class has recently been abstracted to a higher level, for greater
 *  applicability than just Impulse Responses, but it needs some testing in
 *  real-world applications to make sure further parameterization is unneeded.
